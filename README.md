##Phase 4: Task3

I believe that I made an adequate version of a cardgame using the knowledge I had. I used various topics taught in class while working
on this project and that helped me understand the material. Each of my classes are only responsible for ome function which helped me with
the overall design of the project.

Changes

- I would make move and card an abstract class and actually make the different moves and classes as seperate classes.
- I would add more fields in classes so that there's a stronger relationship between the class.
- I would like to make the GUI more interactive and in theme with the app.
