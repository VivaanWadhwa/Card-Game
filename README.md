# My Personal Project

## 2D world Video Game
I plan to build a **2D World** game which has an **active inventory system** and **health system**, with items which can be used in **battle** and also to **boost stats**. The game will be fairly easy to beat and can be played by anyone. This project is interesting to me because I'm an avid video gameenjoyer and I would like to see how one is made.
